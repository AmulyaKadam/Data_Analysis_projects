## Overview  
The Music Store Analysis project investigates **track sales, customer demographics, and revenue by region** for a digital music platform. SQL queries were used to join multiple tables (albums, artists, customers, invoices), while Python handled advanced analytics and visualizations.  

The primary objective was to uncover **best-selling genres, artist popularity, and customer buying patterns** across different geographies.  

---

## Business Problem  
- Which **music genres and artists** contribute the most revenue?  
- How does revenue vary by **country and region**?  
- Who are the **top customers** and what are their purchasing behaviors?  
- Can we identify potential upselling/cross-selling opportunities?  

---

## Dataset  
- Relational database (`music_store.db`) containing:  
  - **Albums, Artists, Tracks** (track name, genre, duration, price)  
  - **Invoices** (purchase details, amounts, dates)  
  - **Customers** (name, country, email, spending history)  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL**: Joins, subqueries, aggregation  
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis & reporting  
- **GitHub** for version control

## Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Removed duplicate track entries  
- Standardized country names and currencies  
- Created a **genre revenue summary table** for further analysis  
- Calculated total revenue per customer  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Genre Analysis**: Rock dominates with ~35% of sales, followed by Latin and Metal  
- **Artist Revenue**: Top 10 artists = ~50% of store revenue  
- **Geographic Trends**:  
  - USA and Canada lead in overall purchases  
  - Brazil shows strong growth potential  
- **Customer Spending**: Small subset of VIP customers responsible for disproportionate revenue  

---

## Research Questions & Key Findings  
1. **Which genre is most popular?** â†’ Rock  
2. **Which artist generates the most revenue?** â†’ Top artist revenue ~3x higher than average  
3. **Which country spends the most?** â†’ USA leads by total revenue, but Germany & Brazil show higher ARPU (average revenue per user)  
4. **Who are the top customers?** â†’ Top 5 spenders contribute ~15% of total sales

## Dashboard  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Genre sales distribution (Pie Chart)  
  - Revenue by country (Bar Chart)  
  - Top artists by revenue (Bar Chart)
